### Installation

npm:

```sh
cd docs-v2 && npm install
```

yarn: 

```sh
cd docs-v2 && yarn install
```

### Local Development


npm: 

```sh
npm run start
```

yarn: 

```sh
yarn run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

npm:

```sh
npm build
```

yarn: 

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The docs is deployed on Netlify, so if you just commit the changes, then Netlify will go ahead and build it and deploy it by itself.
