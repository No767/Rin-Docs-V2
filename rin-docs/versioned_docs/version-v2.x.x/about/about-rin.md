# About Rin

Rin is a Discord Bot focused on obtaining data from third-party services and integrations with speed. Rin currently supports MyAnimeList, Hypixel, Spigot, DeviantArt, Twitter, and much more. For example, Rin allows you to fetch data about your favorite manga or anime, or fetch the latest mentions of a tweet from the given user. Rin is also focused on speed, providing the content within seconds powered by AIOHTTP and Orjson (and v2.x uses more efficient and faster code and algorithms to get the job done). Under the hood, Rin uses [Uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop), which makes Rin 2 times faster than Node.js and just as fast as many programs written in Go. For more information on what services are currently supported, refer to the [Supported Services](./supported-services.md) page.
